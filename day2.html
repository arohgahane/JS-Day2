    <b>what are strings?</b> <br>
    Anything wbhich is written inside single/double quote. <br>
    <br>

    <b>what are boolean values?</b> <br>
    It has only two values i.e is true or false. <br>
    <br>

    <b>what are numbers?</b> <br>
    includes integers, decimals ex. 10, 29, 30.1, 100.001 <br>
    <br>

    <b>Variables :</b> They are used to store the values which could be  of any type i.e. Number type or String type or Boolean type. <br>
    <br>

    1.Rules for assigning names to variables. <br>
    2.Try to make the variable name declarative. <br>
    3.It uses Camel cases. <br>
    4.Variable names are case sensitive. <br>
    <b><i>FName, fname, Fname, fnAme, fnaMe</i></b> <br>
    <br>

    <b>Keywords are of three types</b> <br>
    1.let <br>
    2.var <br>
    3.const <br> <br>

 <!-- --------declaring / initializing/ redeclaring------------ -->

    <b>let = These keywords are used to assign variables with values.</b> <br>
    1. They can be declared in a line and then initialized with a value in another line. <br>
    2. They can be also declared and initialized in the same line. <br>
    3. They cannot be redeclared.... but can be reinitialized. <br>
    4. **** We cannot have Two variables with same name in let****** <br>
    <br>

    <pre>
        let FName = "Aroh"; // declared and initialized in same line
        let fname;
        fname = "Krushna";
        console.log(fname);
        fname = "Gahane";
        console.log(fname);
    </pre>

    <b>const = These keywords are used to assign variables with values.</b> <br>
    1. They can be also declared and initialized in the same line only. <br>
    2. They cannot be redeclared. <br>
    3. But const can't  be reinitialized also. <br>
    4. **** We cannot have Two variables with same name in const****** <br>

    <pre>
        const lname = "Gahane1";
        // lname = "Aroh";
        console.log(lname);
    </pre>


    <b>var = These keywords are used to assign variables with values.</b> <br>
    1. They can be declared in a line and then initialized with a value in another line. <br>
    2. They can be also declared and initialized in the same line. <br>
    3. They can be redeclared and also can be reinitialized. <br>
    4. **** We can have Two or more variables with same name in var****** <br>

    <pre>
        var age = 25;
        var age;
        age = 26;
        console.log(age);
        age = 27;
        console.log(age);
